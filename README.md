# What is exception?

1. In Java, Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
2. These exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as invalid user input, file not found, or division by zero.
3. When an exception occurs, it is typically represented by an object of a subclass of the java.lang.Exception class.
4. It contains information about the exception, such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the program when the exception occurred.

# What is error?

Errors represent exceptional conditions that are not expected to be caught under normal circumstances.  it’s not possible to anticipate and recover from them.
They are typically caused by issues outside the control of the application, such as system failures or resource exhaustion.
OutOfMemoryError: It occurs when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) cannot allocate enough memory for the application.
StackOverflowError: It is thrown when the stack memory is exhausted due to excessive recursion.
NoClassDefFoundError: It indicates that the JVM cannot find the definition of a class that was available at compile-time.

# What is exception handling?
Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, IndexOutOfBoundException, IOException, SQLException etc.
The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application.
